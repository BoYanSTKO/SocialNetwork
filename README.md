# SocialNetwork
The implementation uses B-Tree, hash table and adjacency list. B-Tree is use to perform range search, hash table and adjacency list are used to manage relationships between users.

*Functionality*:
* insert and delete users from the social network
* read profile data from disk and write new users into profile data on disk
* search for users either with a specific name or with a name range
* add friendship relationships between users
* list friends' information of a user
* check common friends of two users
* find the degree of deparation between two users (implemented using Dijkstra's algorithm)
